# DotGUI Search code
From <a href="https://github.com/x8rr/sail-sj">x8rr's Sail-SJ</a>, just accommodated for DotGUI, so yeah my version works better in my opinion.
Might swap the transports out too, if I think that works as well.
## Changes from Sail-SJ
- Wisp from wisp.rhw.one --> anura.pro
- Search Engine from Brave --> DuckDuckGo
- Scramjet scripts from on site --> Externally
